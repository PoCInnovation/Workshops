# Practical Tasks - Smart Contract Development

Now that you understand blockchain fundamentals, let's get hands-on! This section contains practical tasks to build your first smart contract from scratch.

## Overview

You will complete the following tasks:

### Task 1: Complete Smart Contract Development Cycle
This is the main task where you'll learn the entire smart contract development workflow:

**Core Tasks:**
1. **Setup Development Environment** - Install and configure Foundry
2. **Initialize Project** - Create a new Forge project
3. **Clean Project** - Remove unnecessary files
4. **Create Smart Contract** - Write your first contract
5. **Write Tests** - Create comprehensive tests using Foundry
6. **Test Locally** - Run tests to ensure everything works

**Bonus Task:**
7. **Deploy on Sepolia** - Deploy your contract on the Sepolia testnet

## Task Structure

Each task is organized in its own directory with:
- **README.md** - Step-by-step instructions
- **Example code** - Code snippets and examples
- **Validation criteria** - How to know you've completed the task successfully

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting the tasks, make sure you have:
- ✅ Read the [Blockchain Fundamentals](../BLOCKCHAIN.md)
- ✅ A computer with internet connection
- ✅ Terminal/command line access
- ✅ Code editor (VSCode recommended)

### Installation Requirements
You will install these tools during Task 1:
- **Foundry** - Smart contract development framework
- **Git** - Version control (usually pre-installed)

For the bonus Sepolia deployment, you'll also need:
- **MetaMask wallet** - Browser wallet extension
- **Alchemy account** - RPC provider
- **Test ETH** - From Sepolia faucet (ask workshop organizer)

## Task Progression

### 📋 Task 1: [Complete Smart Contract Development](./task1/README.md)
**Estimated time**: 45-60 minutes

**What you'll learn**:
- Setting up a professional development environment
- Creating and structuring smart contracts
- Writing comprehensive tests
- Best practices for smart contract development

**What you'll build**:
- A complete smart contract with tests
- Professional development setup
- **Bonus**: Contract deployed on Sepolia testnet

## Tips for Success

### 1. Read Instructions Carefully
Each task has detailed step-by-step instructions. Read them completely before starting.

### 2. Don't Rush
Take time to understand each concept. It's better to understand one thing well than to rush through everything.

### 3. Test Everything
After each step, test that everything works before moving to the next step.

### 4. Ask for Help
If you're stuck:
- Re-read the instructions
- Check the troubleshooting section
- Ask the workshop organizer
- Look at the provided links for more information

### 5. Experiment
Once you complete the basic requirements, try modifying the code to see what happens!

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Permission Errors
If you get permission errors:
- On macOS/Linux: You might need to use `sudo` for some commands
- On Windows: Run terminal as Administrator

### Network Issues
If installations fail:
- Check your internet connection
- Try using a different network
- Some corporate networks block certain downloads

### Version Conflicts
If you have old versions of tools:
- Follow the uninstall instructions in the task
- Install the latest versions as specified

## Getting Help

### During the Workshop
- **Ask the instructor** - Don't hesitate to raise your hand
- **Help your neighbors** - Learning together is more fun
- **Check the troubleshooting sections** in each task

### After the Workshop
- **Community Discord** - Join blockchain development communities
- **Documentation** - All tools have excellent documentation
- **Stack Overflow** - Search for similar issues
- **GitHub Issues** - Report bugs in the tools you're using
