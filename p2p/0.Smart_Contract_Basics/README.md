# Workshop - Smart Contract Basics

✔ 🌐 **Understand Blockchain and Addresses**  
✔ 🛠️ **Create Your First Smart Contract**  
✔ 🚀 **Deploy and Test on Blockchain**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Contract Basics workshop! This workshop is designed for beginner developers who want to learn blockchain development from scratch. You'll understand how blockchain works, create your first smart contract, and deploy it on a real blockchain network.

## Prerequisites

This workshop requires **no prior blockchain knowledge**. All you need is:
- A computer with internet connection
- Basic programming understanding (helpful but not required)
