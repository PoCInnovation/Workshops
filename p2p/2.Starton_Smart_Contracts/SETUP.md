# Setup

## Postman

To make API calls, you will need to install a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

> ðŸ’¡ You can also use [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) (often already installed on your computer), or whatever other tool you want for your tests since they will be personal, but we highly recommend `postman` as we will explain you how to use it.

## Starton

In this workshop, you'll use [Starton](https://www.starton.io/), a service to easily connect Web2 applications to blockchain with a simple API.  
With it, you can do a lot of things: monitoring on-chain events, deploying an interacting with smart contracts, uploading files to IPFS...
It's a great starting point for web developers who wants to get involved in blockchain and Web3 without a steep learning curve.  

The only thing you need to do is to create an account on <https://app.starton.io/> and you're ready to go ðŸš€
