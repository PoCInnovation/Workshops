# Setup

## Postman

To make API calls, you will need to install a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

> ðŸ’¡ You can also use [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) (often already installed on your computer), or whatever other tool you want for your tests since they will be personal, but we highly recommend `postman` as we will explain you how to use it.

## Forge

Please follow the instructions given [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

After the installation, run the following command to ensure it has been properly installed on your computer:

```shell
forge --version
```

It should print your current version.

## Initialize your project

Now we will initialize the project:

```shell
forge init Roshambo
```

> For those wondering, Roshambo is simply another name for the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors.
