In order to launch our music platform, you have to download Docker and the `source.zip`
which contains the code of our web application.
* [Docker](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/Workshops/blob/master/software/04.Docker/SETUP.md)
* Download the [source.zip](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/Workshops/raw/p2p/digital_ipfs/p2p/3.IPFS_or_HTTP/sources.zip), move it to your working directory `mv ~/Downloads/sources.zip <path-to-your-working-directory> ; cd <path-to-your-working-directory>` and unzip it `unzip ./sources.zip`.
