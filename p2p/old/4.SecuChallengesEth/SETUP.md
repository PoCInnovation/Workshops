# 🔧 Setup
Before starting any of the following challenges, you need to set up a proper environment.
You can use the code editor of your choice, but we highly recommend using the online Remix Editor available [here](https://remix.ethereum.org).

It has all required features for smart contract development :
- A builtin Solidity compiler
- A local ethereum network with 10 accounts already funded with 100 Ether
- A syntax highlighter

In the `Solidity compiler` tab :
- Set the compiler version to `0.4.21`
- Select the `auto-compile` checkbox.

In the `Deploy & run transactions` :
- The environment refers to the ethereum network you're using.
  JavaScript VM means that the code will execute on a local network
  Injected Web3 will use metamask to connect to the real Ethereum network.
