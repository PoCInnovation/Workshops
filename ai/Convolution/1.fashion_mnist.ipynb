    "Your accuracy is probably 89% on the train game and 87% on the validation game... not too bad... But how can you improve this score? We can use convolutions. We won't go into too much detail here, but the concept of convolutional neural networks is to learn to detect specific patterns in the content of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever done image processing using a filter (like here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing), then you will be very familiar with convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, you take a filter (usually 3x3 or 5x5) and pass it over the image. By modifying the underlying pixels according to the formula of this matrix-represented filter, you can perform operations such as edge detection. So, for example, if you look at the link above, you'll see that for a 3x3 filter set for edge detection, the middle cell is set to 8 and all of its neighbors to -1. In this case, for each pixel, you will multiply its value by 8, then subtract the value of each neighbor. Doing this for each pixel will result in a new image with improved edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perfect for computer vision, because often the features that define an object only represent a part of the whole image, and the information we need is much weaker than all the pixels in the image. image. This concept then allows us to focus only on features that are highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding convolution layers before your dense layers, the information provided to the dense layers is much more focused, and potentially more accurate.\n",
