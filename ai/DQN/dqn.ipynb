    "it is the same function we defined earlier in `target_value()`\n",

    "With these in mind, the algorithm should already make more sense to you.\n",

    "- <b>replay memory D</b>:\\\n",
    "The DQN relies on the agent's past experiences for its training.\\\n",
    "The replay memory `D` is a list of every moment in the agent's life, comprising of each `state, reward, action, done` and `new_state` of each iteration of our `for` loop.\\\n",
    "Its capacity `N` is the size of this memory, meaning that once you have `N` elements memorized, the `N+1` element will replace the first element inside the memory (one good way to implement this in python is by using a [deque](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque)).\\\n",

    "- <b>target action-value function Q<sup>-</sup> with weights θ<sup>-</sup> = θ</b>:\\\n",
    "The DQN uses two neural networks: one generally called the `online_network` and its clone, the `target_network` which copies the `online_network`'s weights every `C` steps.\\\n",
    "This method is necessary to stabilize learning and prevent [catastrophic forgetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophic_interference).\\\n",
    "`target_value()` will use the value returned by `target_network.forward()` as its `q_next` argument.\n",

    "    - the learning rate or the optimizer and loss function could have an impact on how well your agent learns: a popular optizimer for DQN is the [RMSProp](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.RMSprop.html) and the prefered loss function is the [SmoothL1Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.SmoothL1Loss.html#torch.nn.SmoothL1Loss)\n",
    "    - maybe you can change the sizes of the hidden layers or their amount\n",
    "- Turn this DQN into a [DoubleDQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf)\n",
    "- Remove the `target_network` entirely by using [DeepMellow](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/pubs/deepmellow.pdf)\n",
    "- Try out [other environments](https://gymnasium.farama.org/): only some minor changes are required for most algorithms. For [Atari games](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/), for example, you only need to preprocess the observations using [gym wrappers](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/wrappers/) and use [convolutions](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html). Be warned, though, because the Atari environments will take a <bold>lot</bold> longer to train than LunarLander !"
