    "Woohoo, here we are.\\\n",
    "This subject is really something you wont see often, this might be really difficult for you if you don't know well subject as linked list.\\\n",
    "Luckily, python help us a bit with classes, and it's much easier than it is in C.\\\n",
    "I guess if you're there, you're a pro right ?\\\n",
    "Anyways, binary tree can open you a lot of new doors, as in data compression, or new architecture of datas (As the file system on a computer).\\\n",
    "This is used in data compression with the Huffman algorithm for example, or in data traversal in database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *How binary trees works ?*\n",
    "Binary trees in a way is just a way to stock data, as you would have with dictionnaries, or linked list (Which are classical list in Python).\\\n",
    "At the opposite of having a linear list (Each data have their next neighbour, or not), trees are hierarchical data structures that can have multiple next neighbours, by using what is called \"nodes\".\\\n",
    "A node is a piece of data that can stock addresses of their next neighbourgs, and each node are independent.\\\n",
    "Concretly, a node is a class, and each data is stocked inside its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Tree visualisation*\n",
    "Now for the visualisation, you can use the really great \"Binarytree\" module, that let you display them in a terminal.\\\n",
    "[Binarytree module](https://pypi.org/project/binarytree/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective :**\\\n",
    "You will have to write a program that represent the database in a binary tree, using each element as a new root.\\\n",
    "Once it's done, you will have to remove every branch that have an odd number of data (Considering the number of node).\\\n",
    "You will have to use in-order Traversal.\n",
