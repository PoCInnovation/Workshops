# Workshop 9 - Event Calendar with Svelte

âœ” Learn Svelte's basic functionalities

âœ” Understand Svelte's advantages

âœ” Start a simple Svelte project

âœ” Deploy a Svelte project

## Step 0 - Initialization

All the required information to install dependencies can be found in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

> :bulb: You may want to take a look at the Svelte [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) and [documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs) for this workshop.

## Step 1 - Your first component

To begin with, we will learn how to create a simple component and display it in our page.

Create a `components` directory in `src/` which will contain a file named `TopBar.svelte`.

Inside it, you'll create a basic top bar that will be `fixed` at the top of your page and display the title of your application.

> Display your component with a cool style :rocket:  
> For this, you can use CSS or a UI library like [Svelte Materialify](https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/)

Then, you can call it inside your `App.svelte` to display it :star_struck:

## Step 2 - Time for Events

You've created your first Svelte components, that's cool! But your application is a bit empty, isn't it sad? ðŸ˜¢

Create file named `Event.svelte` in `src/components`, it will contain a component to display an event with the following props:
  - `id` as a `number`
  - `title` as a `string`
  - `description` as a `string`
  - `startingDate` as a `Date`
  - `endDate` as a `Date`

> :bulb: You can export these variables as types with a [script module](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64064506/export-typescript-type-in-svelte-file) to define your properties.

> :bulb: You may want to create an array with every month of the year displayed properly. The same applies for the days of the week.

Then, create two events in your `App.svelte` and display them.

> Don't forget to apply styles to your components :wink:

## Step 3 - Interaction

It's time to add more events :rocket:

Create a `Button` component which opens a `Form` component in the center of your page.

Your `Button` must store the state of your form (open or closed) as a boolean. You must also add two functions to control the state of the `Form` component.

You have to display another `Button` to close the page when it's open.

## Step 4 - Send your form

Add fields to your `Form` component to add new events.

You must add the following fields:
  - `event name`
  - `description`
  - `start date`
  - `end date`

> :bulb: The [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input) tag will be useful.

> :bulb: Take a look at the [on:submit property](https://svelte.dev/repl/8eb540552faa4651a398b182fa5cdd48?version=3.49.0).

A `button` must appear to cancel the form and another one to submit it. It should add an event to your page.

> :bulb: You should use a [store](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores) to synchronize your components.
