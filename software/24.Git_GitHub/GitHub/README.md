# Part 2: GitHub :rocket:

## Step 0 - Project initialization
Create a repository and commit the files & folders contained in [project folder].
Some steps should be completed in groups of at least 2.
Go to your repository settings, and in the `Collaborators` add your teammate !

<i>Pro tips:</i>
> Don't forget to use the commit norm you learned in the previous part :wink:

> Don't forget to use branches ! This time, try to create it directly in GitHub :rocket:

## Step 1 - Issues
There's a bug in the project (tests failing): create 2 issues (one to fix the bug, one to add a given feature, on two different branches)  
Method: result screen to reproduce or fully autonomous with correction after

## Step 2 - Pull Requests (PR)
Congratulations, you solved these issues !  
But don't close them yet, you will now learn to use Pull Requests and use the option to close issues automatically :sparkles:

Create 2 Pull Requests, and use 2 different methods to link the related issues.
When it's done, add your teammate as reviewer and play with the review tool in the `Files Changed` tab !

<i>Pro tip:</i>

> The first method is pretty obvious, but the second one is implicit, don't hesitate to ask for a hint :bulb:

## Step 3 - Projects
You can now manage features and tasks with issues, group commits and do code reviews with PRs, but how do you actually organize
your work in tables like well-known ticketing tools ? That's where GitHub Projects come into play !

## Step 4 - Milestones
Organizing taks with states like `To do`, `In progress` and `Done` is great, but how to you handle deadlines and group several issues and PRs
linked to a sprint for example ? Milestones are exactly what you need !  
You can find them in the `Issues` tab.

## Step 5 - Actions
