# Part 2: GitHub :rocket:

## Step 0 - Project initialization
Create a repository and commit the files & folders contained in [project folder].
Some steps should be completed in groups of at least 2.
Go to your repository settings, and in the `Collaborators` add your teammate !

<i>Pro tips:</i>
> Don't forget to use the commit norm you learned in the previous part :wink:

> Don't forget to use branches ! This time, try to create it directly in GitHub :rocket:

> This workshop is based on [PoC Innovation's Open-Source project template](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template).  
Several links to specific parts of the [getting started guide](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template/blob/main/.github/getting-started.md) will be given to you, but don't spend too much time on it, we have a lot to cover ! You can read it entirely later.

## Step 1 - [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
On a project, you'll need a tool to track and organize your work: with GitHub Issues, you can track feature requests, user feedbacks and bug reports.  
If you played a bit with the calculator you may notice the given result isn't correct.  
You have to create 3 issues:
- One to describe the problem, with expected behaviour and what you are experiencing.
- Another to suggest a feature (add all the arguments instead of just the first 2)
- A last one to take a single string as parameter and support operators in it (this one will not be implemented)

Method: result screen to reproduce or fully autonomous with correction after

<i>Pro tips:</i>
> Take a look at [labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) and [assignees](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)

> Instead of filling an Issue manually, you can use [templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository). It's really useful to let contributors know what information maintainers need and keep a common structure between issues. You can find some great examples in [our Open-Source project template](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).

## Step 2 - [Pull Requests (PRs)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
Congratulations, you solved these issues !  
But don't close them yet, you will now learn to use Pull Requests and use the option to close issues automatically :sparkles:

Create 2 Pull Requests, and use 2 different methods to link the related issues.
When it's done, add your teammate as reviewer and play with the review tool in the `Files Changed` tab !

<i>Pro tip:</i>

> Take a look at [Closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests) ðŸ˜‰

> As for Issues, [templates are also available for Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository), and we have one [here](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) just for you ðŸ˜‰

## Step 3 - [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)
You can now manage features and tasks with issues, group commits and do code reviews with PRs, but how do you actually organize
your work in tables like well-known ticketing tools ? That's where GitHub Projects come into play !

> A [new GitHub Project experience](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) is currently in public beta. We chose not to cover it because it's subject to major changes, but it brings great features such as [custom fields](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects#adding-metadata-to-your-tasks) and [different views](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects#adding-metadata-to-your-tasks).

## Step 4 - [Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)
Organizing taks with states like `To do`, `In progress` and `Done` is great, but how to you handle deadlines and group several issues and PRs
linked to a sprint for example ? Milestones are exactly what you need !  
You can find them in the `Issues` tab.

<i>Pro tips:</i>
> You won't find a lot of documentation about it, but it's also possible to create [milestone templates](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template/blob/main/.github/milestone_template.md) ðŸš€

## Step 5 - [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)
<u>Pro tips:</u>
> If you want to learn more about GitHub Actions, you can check [our dedicated workshop](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/Workshops/tree/24.Git_Github/software/05.Actions) !

## Step 6 - [Branches protection settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) (optional)
Branch protection rules are a great way to enforce good practices.  
For example, your production branch (usually `main`) should be as clean and bug-free as possible, so you don't want to push directly on it and if you have CI tests with GitHub Actions it's a good practice to ensure they all passed when merging on `main`.  
Even if your collaborators and yourself know this, a mistake or a malicious act may occur and enforcing these practices isn't a bad idea.

Go to `Settings` -> `Code and automation` -> `Branches` and add rules to protect your `main` and `dev` branches.
> Take a look at the [protection settings we recommend for `main`](https://github.com/PoCInnovation/open-source-project-template/blob/main/.github/getting-started.md#branches) and don't hesitate to ask if you have any question about it ðŸ˜‰

## To go further
You've learned how to use a lot of tools provided by GitHub, but there's a lot more to discover !

- The [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) provides some great hands-on courses to grow your skills !  
- [Making open-source contributions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github) is a great way to apply what you've learned in a real project.  
  Pay attention to `good first issue` labels directly on GitHub or on [dedicated sites](https://goodfirstissue.dev/).
