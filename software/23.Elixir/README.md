## Step 0 - Setup

All the required information to start this workshop can be found in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)

## Step 1 - Once upon a time...

there was a little developper (let's call him Little Timmy) who wanted to communicate with his friends.
Rather than using Discord, or some social media, or even IRC, this developper wanted to build his chat app himself...
Of course, Little Timmy looked on Ycmbinator what was the hot JS framework these days, but scrolling through HackerNews,
Little Timmy saw an article about a new way of doing distributed web apps, and thought he could maybe give it a try.
Let's help him build the chat app of his dreams ! :)~
