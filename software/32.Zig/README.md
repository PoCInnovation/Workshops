# Workshop 32 - Introduction to Zig

Welcome to this introductory workshop on Zig! Zig is a modern programming language that emphasizes robustness, performance and clarity. Today, you'll learn :
✔️ How to install Zig
✔️ Create your first project
✔️ Discover the language's key concepts by creating a few projects

## Introduction

Zig is a general-purpose programming language focused on robustness, performance, and simplicity. It offers manual memory management, safety features, built-in cross-compilation, and seamless C interoperability, making it ideal for system programming and high-performance applications.

## Step 0 - SETUP

All the required information to install dependencies can be found in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

> 💡 We recommend you to follow the [Getting started](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) for this workshop.

## Step 1 - Hello World! in Zig

> ❗ We strongly advise you to use the documentation provided for this exercise.

📑 Description:

For the first exercise, we simply ask you to print `Hello world!` in your terminal when you run your program.

📌 Tasks:

Create a file `main.zig` in a folder called `src` with your logic to print the "hello world"

It should look like this 🔽

```sh
src
└── main.zig
```

📚 Documentation:

💡 After creating your main.zig file, you can include and use logic from other Zig files in your project. To do this, you need to integrate the modules from those files into your main.zig. You can achieve this by using the @import statement to include and access the functionality defined in different Zig files.
For more details on including Zig files, check out this guide : <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71186556/how-do-i-include-one-zig-file-from-another-zig-file>

- [Build System](https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/)
- [Doc.Zig](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/)

✔️ Validation:

```sh
zig build-exe src/main.zig
./main
```

you should see the following :

```sh
Hello, World!
```

## Step 2 - Palindrome?

📑 Description:

For the second exercise, you have to create a function that takes as parameter a string named `word`.

📌 Tasks:

Create a file `palindrome.zig` for this new function.

```sh
src
└── main.zig
└── palindrome.zig
```

This function must return true if the word given in parameter is a palindrome and false in the opposite case.

📚 Documentation:

- [What is a palindrome ?](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Palindrome)
- [New function](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Functions)
- [The types in Zig](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Primitive-Types)
- [Control_Structures](https://zig.guide/language-basics/while-loops)

 ✔️ Validation:

Here's a main example :

```zig
pub fn main() void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    const test_word1 = "madam";
    const test_word2 = "hello";
    const result1 = is_palindrome(test_word1);
    const result2 = is_palindrome(test_word2);
    stdout.print("{} is palindrome: {}\n", .{test_word1, result1}) catch {};
    stdout.print("{} is palindrome: {}\n", .{test_word2, result2}) catch {};
}
```

 When you compile and run palindrome.zig, the output should be:

```sh
madam is palindrome: true
```

or

```sh
hello is palindrome: false
```

## Step 3 - A simple and useful `Calculator`

📑 Description:

Let's go further now!

The objective of this fifth exercise is to create a simplified calculator in the terimnal.
For this step you will create a interactive calculator that will take a first number, then the operation and finally the second number and once you have all the information, compute all that and print the result.

📌 Tasks:

- Create a file `calculator.zig` for this new function.

```sh
src
└── main.zig
└── calculator.zig
```

To do this, you have to make a calculator that can do:

- `Addition`
- `Multiplication`
- `Division`
- `Subtraction`

- between two values that must be retrieved one after the other from the user's input.

> 💡 Pay attention to your error handling !

- Display the result of the calculation in your terminal.
For this step you will create a interactive calculator that will take a first number, then the operation and finally the second number and once you have all the information, compute all that and print the result.

📚 Documentation:


- [Errors](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Errors)
- [Memory](https://zig.guide/standard-library/allocators)
- [ArrayList](https://zig.guide/standard-library/arraylist)


  ✔️ Validation:

You should get something like this :

```sh
    First number: 5
    Operation: +
    Second number: 3
    8
```

Here's a typical error handeling example :

```sh
    First number: abc
    Operation: +
    Second number: 3
    Expected Output: Error message indicating invalid input.
```

## Step 4 - Pascal's Triangle Line

📑 Description:

Let's dive into a more advanced topic!

The objective of this exercise is to generate the n-th line of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. For this step, you will create a function that takes an int32 parameter n and returns a list of numbers corresponding to the n-th line of the triangle.

📌 Tasks:

Create a file pascals_triangle.zig for this new function.

Your project structure should look like this 🔽

```sh
    src
    └── main.zig
    └── pascals_triangle.zig
```

Implement the function to compute the n-th line of Pascal's Triangle. You will need to:
    Create a function that computes the binomial coefficients for the given line index n.
    Use an efficient method to calculate these coefficients.
    Return a list of coefficients that represents the n-th line of Pascal's Triangle.

Test your implementation by adding a main function that prints out the line of Pascal's Triangle for a given n.

📚 Documentation:

Factorials : <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Factorial>
Binomial Coefficient: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient>
Array Manipulation <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Array>

✔️ Validation:

To validate your exercise, compile and run your program. You should see output similar to the following:

```sh
zig build-exe src/pascals_triangle.zig
./pascals_triangle
```

Expected output:

```sh
Line 5 of Pascal's Triangle: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1
```

Ensure your program correctly calculates and displays the n-th line of Pascal's Triangle. Check different values of n to verify that the output is accurate.

## Bonuses - TO DO List and C Code translation

### TO DO List

📑 Description:

Now that you're used to the basics, you will do a little project to apply what you've learnt so far.

📌 Tasks:

Create a command-line todo list application where you can:

- Add a new todo
- Delete a todo by ID
- View all todos

Each todo should have at least three fields:

- id (auto-incremented) which will be an integer
- name which will be a string
- description which will also be a string

> 💡 To easily test your functions during this workshop remember to check the testing tools mentioned above

📚 Documentation:

    Choose an action:
    1. Add Todo
    2. Delete Todo
    3. View Todos

    10. Delete Todo
    11. View Todos
    12. Exit
    > 4
```

> 💡 Pay attention to your error handling !

### Use The C Translation tool

📑 Description:

Zig provides the command zig translate-c for automatic translation from C source code. You can try to read the documentation and have fun with the tool.
