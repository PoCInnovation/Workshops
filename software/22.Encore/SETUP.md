# Workshop 22 - Setup

In this workshop, you'll need:

- [docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/): docker community edition
- [go](https://golang.org/doc/install): golang language and compiler
- [encore CLI](https://encore.dev/docs/quick-start#install-the-encore-cli): encore official CLI

## Installation

### Docker

First, remove these packages if installed on your dump:

```bash
sudo dnf remove docker                   \
                docker-client            \
                docker-client-latest     \
                docker-common            \
                docker-latest            \
                docker-latest-logrotate  \
                docker-logrotate         \
                docker-selinux           \
                docker-engine-selinux    \
                docker-engine
```

Then for fedora, install `docker-ce`:

```bash
# To add the docker repository to dnf
sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo

# To install docker's latest version:
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

> If you're not on fedora, [a tutorial for other distros is available](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)

#### Enable docker

Once the installation is complete, start the docker service with `sudo systemctl start docker`

> If you want Docker to run every time you start your computer, run `sudo systemctl enable docker`

For this workshop, you have to run your docker commands with `sudo`, if you find a command on the Internet without it, it will not work without adding your user to the docker group (which requires logging out of your session, which we will not do).

#### Fedora 31+

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are running fedora 31 or above, you'll probably have `cgroups` errors like:

```shell
docker: Error response from daemon: cgroups: cannot found cgroup mount destination: unknown.
```

To fix them, follow this [solution](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/219#issuecomment-375160449) on docker's github. This solution requires to be executed each time you reboot

#### Podman alternative

If you're unable to install Docker, you can alternatively use [podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) which works just like Docker. To use podman, simply replace `docker` by `podman` in every command that you run as shown below.

```shell
podman run hello-world
```

### Golang

To install Go, run the following commands:
```shell
# Download go
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Extract the archive and add the binaries to /usr/local
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Then, open your .zshrc or .bashrc file and append the following line at the end:
```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

### Encore CLI

Install the CLI following the [official tutorial](https://encore.dev/docs/quick-start#install-the-encore-cli).

Add those lines into your shellrc (should be `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`)
```bash
export ENCORE_INSTALL="/home/vasek/.encore"
export PATH="$ENCORE_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

To verify that the CLI is correctly installed, tip the command below
```shell
encore version
encore version v0.17.2
```

## Build foundation

Now we are going create an Encore application.

### Creation

To create an app with `encore`, tip the following command
```shell
encore app create
```

Then follow the steps given by the CLI
- Login to encore website
- Tip your application's name (e.g `poc-workshop-encore`)
- Choose the `Hello World` template
- Wait until the project is created

Now, you should see a new folder in your current directory with your application's name

Let's check what is in that folder

```shell
# Jump into your application's folder (e.g cd poc-workshop-encore)
cd <application's name>

# List files in your application
tree
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ encore.app # Encore config file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod     # Go module
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.sum     # Go dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello      # Hello service
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.go      # Hello API
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello_test.go # Hello API Test
```

### Test

Let's start our application to be sure that everything works

```shell
encore run
```

It should display you something like below

```shell

  ‚úî Building Encore application graph... Done!
  ‚úî Analyzing service topology... Done!
  ‚úî Generating boilerplate code... Done!
  ‚úî Compiling application source code... Done!

  Encore development server running!

  Your API is running at:     http://localhost:4000
  Development Dashboard URL:  http://localhost:41121/delivery-api-rrqi

2:35PM INF registered endpoint endpoint=World path=/hello/:name service=hello

```

Execute a `curl` on the `World` endpoint
```shell
curl localhost:4000/hello/John
{
  "Message": "Hello, John!"
}
```

You can now stop the application with a `CTRL +C` in the running terminal.

> üí° You can also run application's test with `encore test ./<your service>`
> E.g `encore test ./hello`
