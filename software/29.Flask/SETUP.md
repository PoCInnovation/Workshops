# Setup

## Python & Flask

In this workshop, we will create an HTTP REST server using Flask and interact with a MySQL database.
First of all, you have make sure you have [**Python 3.7** or higher installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

If you have the right version installed, you should have something similar:
```sh
python --version || python3 --version
> Python 3.10.6 # OK
```

We'll now create our project in a virtual environment and install packages we need:
```sh
mkdir flask-workshop-poc && cd flask-workshop-poc

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install flask mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
```

## MySQL

> If you already have MariaDB the commands below should also work, you don't need to install MySQL :wink:

Ubuntu: [Installation guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04)  
Fedora: [Installation guide](https://www.tecmint.com/install-mysql-fedora-linux/)  

If you have the right version installed, you should have something similar:
```sh
mysql --version
> mysql   Ver 8.0.30-0ubuntu0.22.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu)) # OK
```

You should be able to login using this command:
```sh
mysql -u <user> -p
```
> :bulb: For this workshop you can use the `root` user, but it's usually better to [create another user with scoped privileges](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/mysql/how-create-mysql-user-and-grant-permissions-command-line).
