# Workshop 29 - Flask Backend with MySQL

:heavy_check_mark: Discover [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), a lighweight framework to build a Python backend.

:heavy_check_mark: Interact with a MySQL database

:heavy_check_mark: Build a basic todo list & authentification system


## Step 0: Initialization

In this workshop, you'll lean how to use Flask to easily create a REST API performing operations on a database. 

> :bulb: A quick [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis) about REST API.

All the required information to install the workshop's dependencies are given in the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)

## Step 1: Create your first endpoint :rocket:

Now that everything is installed, let's create a basic Flask application. 
> Don't worry, Flask is designed for a quick and simple start :wink:

- Create a file `app.py`, in which you will initialize Flask with a basic route:
    - It should listen on the `/` endpoint
    - Use the `GET` method only
    - Respond with `Hello world`

To test your route, you can use `flask run` to launch the server and open your browser at http://localhost:5000.
> :bulb: Several options can be provided to `flask run` to customize it's behaviour (the debug mode can be useful to reload the server when your file changes).  
> You can also run your app from your Python file with specific parameters and launch it with `python app.py` :wink: 

## Step 2: Register

Congratulations, you have succesfully created your first endpoint :partying_face:  
The next step is to add a route to register users.  
But first, you need to create your database using the [`db.sql`](./src/db.sql) file. This can be done with this command:
```sh
mysql -u <user> -p < db.sql
```
It will create a database with 2 tables, `user` and `todo`.  
To interact with it, we are also giving you the file `database.py`. It creates the connection with the DB for you, your job will be to add methods to perform SQL queries and use them in your app.

> If you take a look at `database.py`, you'll notice we are loading several database config values from the environment.  
> Create a `.env` file and add the corresponding variables, Flask will then automatically load them for you :wink:

Create a `/register` endpoint using the POST method. Every call must provide 2 JSON params: an email and a password.
> :bulb: You can access the params using the [request object](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#incoming-request-data)

Once you retrieved those params, add a `create_user` method in `database.py` to insert them in the `user` table.
> :bulb: The [official documentation of the mysql connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) will be useful to discover how to perform queries.  
> You will also need to write some SQL, here's [a small cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql/modules/learn-sql-manipulation/cheatsheet)
to help you getting starting with SQL :rocket:

Test your route using postman, and don't forget to add some error handling in case your insertion failed.  

## Step 3: Login

Now that we are able to create users, the next logical step is to retrieve a registered user.

But wait, didn't we forget something in the previous step?  
In a real-world scenario, storing the password without any form of encryption is a really bad practice: any person who manages to access our database could log as any user :warning:

Update your previous code to hash the password before storing it :lock:

> You can use [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/) to generate the hash and check it later

Alright, we can now move on to the next route:  
Create a `/login` endpoint with the same characteristics than `/register`, but this time you will check if the data given matches an user in your table.

> :bulb: Don't forget what you did just before: the stored password in now hashed :wink:

## Step 4: Add a todo

The user part is functional, congratulations!  
Now let's add another simple endpoint to interact with another table of our database:

The goal is to create a todo for an user by POSTing on the `/todos` route.  
> As always, don't forget to handle errors and display a success message at the end :wink:

## Step 5: Retrieve todos differently

Creating todos is great, but being able to retrieve them is better!
For this, you'll use the same endpoint `/todos` but with the `GET` method.

Instead of duplicating your decorators with the only change being the method, you should use [flask_restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
to handle this case in a cleaner way :rocket:

> :bulb: You can return an array of strings corresponding to the todos' content, we don't need the other fields

## To go further

- Use an ORM like [SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/) for easier database interactions
- Add a real authentication using [JWT](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-JWT-and-how-to-implement-with-Flask) and restrict access to `/todos`
