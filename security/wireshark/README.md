# Workshop - Wireshark Network Analysis

✔ What is Wireshark

✔ Analyze network traffic and protocols

✔ Master packet capture and analysis techniques

## Introduction in a few lines

### What is Wireshark?

**Wireshark** is a **free and open-source network protocol analyzer** that allows you to **capture** and **inspect** network traffic in real-time or from saved capture files. It is one of the most widely used tools for **network troubleshooting**, **security analysis**, and **protocol development**. Wireshark enables you to **see what's happening** on your network at a microscopic level, examining individual packets and their contents.

### Why it is useful?

The **primary advantage** of Wireshark lies in its ability to **deeply analyze network communications** and **troubleshoot network issues**. This tool **provides visibility** into network traffic that is otherwise invisible, allowing developers, network administrators, and security professionals to **understand network behavior**, **identify performance problems**, **detect security threats**, and **verify protocol implementations**. Whether you're debugging a web application, investigating a security incident, or learning how network protocols work, Wireshark gives you the **insights needed** to understand what's happening on the wire.

### What technology is used to do this?

**Wireshark** uses **packet capture libraries** (such as libpcap on Linux/Unix and WinPcap/Npcap on Windows) to **intercept network traffic** from network interfaces. It then **parses hundreds of protocols** and **displays packet contents** in a human-readable format. The tool supports **deep packet inspection**, **statistical analysis**, and **filtering capabilities** that enable users to **focus on specific traffic patterns** or **protocols of interest**. If you've never used Wireshark before, please refer to the [setup.md](./setup.md) file to configure it properly and securely.

## Step 0 - Setup

Please refer to the [setup.md](./setup.md) file.

## Workshop Exercises

This workshop includes several hands-on exercises to help you master Wireshark:

- **Exercise 1**: Basic HTTP analysis - Understanding HTTP requests and responses
- **Exercise 2**: HTTP Headers - Analyzing authentication mechanisms
- **Exercise 3**: HTTPS - Understanding encryption and certificates
- **Exercise 4**: GSM protocol analysis
- **Exercise 5**: TCP streams and conversations
- **Exercise 6**: USB traffic analysis
- **Exercise 7**: Forensic analysis - Real-world traffic investigation

You just completed the Wireshark workshop, well done! During this workshop, you learned what Wireshark is and how to use it to analyze various network protocols and traffic patterns. You can find more resources and documentation on the [official Wireshark website](https://www.wireshark.org/), if you want to continue exploring advanced features and techniques.

I hope you enjoyed the workshop!

## To go further

You have discovered the basics of Wireshark but there are still many other concepts to explore, here are some examples:

- Advanced filtering techniques and display filters
- Custom protocol dissectors development
- Network performance analysis and statistics
- Wireless network analysis (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
- VoIP analysis (SIP, RTP)
- Malware traffic analysis and threat hunting
