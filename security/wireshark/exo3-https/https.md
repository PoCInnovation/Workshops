# 🕵️ Challenge 3 — HTTPS

## 📖 Context

This time, the credentials are not sent in the headers but in the **body of the POST request**. The application sends a JSON containing the credentials.


## 🎯 Goal

**There is no flag to find in this challenge !**

The purpose here is to understand why the content is unreadable.
> HTTP and certificates notions should be helpful ;)

## 📂 File provided
