HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Download the files here: <https://pwnh4.com/poc-workshop-craft.zip>

When you have unzip this folder, you have to:

1. Install libcurl4-openssl-dev with your system packet manager, if not already installed
2. Do a `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && ./craft`

Load the binary in writable mode in Cutter and use the edition feature to bypass all the license checks !
