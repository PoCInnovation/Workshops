# Angr Workshop

## Launch the workshop

* You must download `Pycharm Edu` or install `edu-tools` on pycharm
* Then open the zip file directly in pycharm edu (do not unzip it)
* In Pycharm, open a terminal to be in the virtual env of the workshop and make a `pip3 install angr`
* Then launch the build.sh at the root of the workshop files to download the binary
* The exercises order: Find, Avoid, Condition, Registers, Stack, Memory

## Usual issues

* If you cannot install Angr because it cannot find <Python.h> install either `python3-devel` on fedora or `python3-dev` on ubuntu
* If you get an error `File not found` when you execute the binaries, it's because you cannot execute 32bits binaries, therefore do install a 32b lib like `glibc.i686`
* If pycharm throws an error with a message containing something like "python 3.0 3.7 3.7 3.7", open the yaml configuration file and delete the line containing those info.
