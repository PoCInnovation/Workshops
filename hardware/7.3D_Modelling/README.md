# Hardware Pool: 3D modelling

In this workshop you will learn the basics of 3D modeling with Fusion 360. ðŸ’ª
The exercises are of increasing difficulty.

You will first learn how to create objects and then how to link several objects to create a larger one.

At the end of this workshop you will be creating simple objects. These objects can be printed with a 3D printer.

In case of blockages, do not hesitate to ask the workshop leader.

## Setup:

The first step is to install Fusion 360, you can find the necessary documentation just below: ðŸ“š
You go to this [link](https://www.autodesk.fr/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual) and go to **mise en route**.

You just need to create an account with the epitech link.

## Exercise 1: First things first: the basics

### 1.1 Make a Square
Your first object is the creation of a square.
You will learn how to **extrude** ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
Make a cube of 57.58mm side (Careful, we'll come and check the measurements!)

## 1.2 Make a Sphere âš«

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
Still more, you can now try to make your first sphere. ðŸ‘€

## Exercise 2: Let's get technical

You now know how to make solid shapes.
We can move on to the second step of this workshop.

### 2.1 Make empty Shape
### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
You will be able to use your basics from the previous step to make an empty shape.
Your handle should be rounded like on the picture below.

Make a box with handles.

### 2.2 Telephone stand ðŸ“±
### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
You might as well mix the useful with the pleasant.
An object that is often needed without having it at hand. We will create a phone holder.

### 2.3 Make a Vase

We will now move on to a much more complex step. You will be able to make your first vase.

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
Vases can have any shape.
Today we are going to ask you to create a **horn** vase.

You have a very good representation of the type of vase you are asked to make below.

## Exercise 3: Movement ðŸ’¨

Making a single object is good but combining different parts to create an object is better but also more complex.

It's time to stay focused. ðŸ‘“

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
First create your empty box.
Then adjust it to allow for a sliding top.

In fact, make a box with a sliding top

## Exercise 4: Realer than real ðŸ”§

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
Make a servomotor. Nothing too fancy, but try to get as close as you can to the model.

## Exercise 5:

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:
> For this exercise, you will have to make a car ðŸš™ , a rocket ðŸš€ , or even a pocket watch if that is what you like. The important thing is that it is printable and that it measures less than 10 cmÂ³. This is the average size that is suitable for the 3D printer. ðŸŽ†

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulation !

You now know the basics of 3D modelling. Feel free to use your imagination to implement many other shapes.
Or combine the previous exercises for new results.
