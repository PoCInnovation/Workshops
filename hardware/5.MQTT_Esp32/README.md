## Story

The schema below shows the architecture of broker MQTT:

![Data scheme](../../.github/assets/hardware/Mqtt/mqtt.png)

**Explanation** <br/>
Each device can publish on a broker local or global.<br/>
The Broker is an intermediary between devices and subscribers. <br/>
It allows to store, process and share the data to other entities. <br/>
Whether it is another broker or his phone to be aware of an alert according to the data.<br/>

## Setup:
- [SETUP](../SETUP.md)

## Step 01 - Turn on an LED

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- ESP32
- USB cable

</details>  

### 📑 Description:
Your first objective is to light an LED on your ESP32 with code.

### 📌 Tasks:
Use the LED on your card or an external LED and turn it on.  

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Tutorial PlatformIO and ESP32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmvMvIphMnY)
- [Turn on LED function](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/)

## Step 02 - LED flash

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- ESP32
- USB cable

</details>

### 📑 Description:
Now it's time to make your LED blink.  <br/>
To do this, implement some code in your ESP32. <br/>

### 📌 Tasks:
Your LED must blink with 500 ms.

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Tutorial PlatformIO and ESP32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmvMvIphMnY)
- [Turn on LED Tutorial ESP32](https://circuits4you.com/2018/02/02/esp32-led-blink-example/)

## Step 03 - Connect to WI-FI

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- ESP32
- USB cable

</details>

### 📑 Description:  

For this step, you will set ssid and password for connect your board to the WI-Fi. <br/>
Integred conditional state for print Wi-fi and Ip Address of your device. <br/>

- To print data you must use serial connection.
- The first purpose of the MQTT IOT is a Wi-Fi.

### 📌 Tasks:

- Print the `ip` of your board in `serial monitor`

### 📚 Documentation:
- [ESP32 Wi-Fi configuration](https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap07%20-%20Wi-Fi%20Connections.html)
- [Function to serial connection](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/)
- [Init Serial Connection](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/ifserial/)

### ✔️ Validation:

- Ping your device.  
If this step is ending you can go out to the next step. 🎉


## Step 04 - SetUp Mosquitto

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- Your Computer

</details>

### 📑 Description:  

Now that you have an network to your esp32. <br/>
This is the first step. <br/>
Then you must understand and work MQTT IoT. <br/>

- Take your computer and [download Mosquitto](https://everythingsmarthome.co.uk/howto/how-to-install-an-mqtt-broker-mosquitto-install-config-on-debian-ubuntu-mint-fedora-raspbian/). <br/>
- On this piece you have a [Broker MQTT](https://www.journaldunet.fr/web-tech/dictionnaire-de-l-iot/1440686-mqtt-comment-fonctionne-ce-protocole/) with a raspberry. <br/>

### 📌 Tasks:

- Call a manager to explain how a broker works. 👋

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Download Mosquitto](https://everythingsmarthome.co.uk/howto/how-to-install-an-mqtt-broker-mosquitto-install-config-on-debian-ubuntu-mint-fedora-raspbian/)
- [Broker MQTT](https://www.journaldunet.fr/web-tech/dictionnaire-de-l-iot/1440686-mqtt-comment-fonctionne-ce-protocole/)

## Step 05 - SetUp your first Subscribe to Mosquitto

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- Your computer

</details>

### 📑 Description:

Now it's time to know how subscribes to a topic.

### 📌 Tasks:

> This information is necessary to communicate with the Broker 🚀

**Topic** : /Workshop/Hardware/MQTT  
**Username** : MosquiFruit  
**Password** : SendMeYourEmail  

- First step : Subscribe to all topics
- Second step : Subscribe to specific topic /Workshop/Hardware/MQTT
> 😊 Subscribe to the topic

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Subscribe Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html)
- [Template subscribe](https://docs.solace.com/Open-APIs-Protocols/MQTT/MQTT-Topics.htm)
- [Example Subscribe](https://projetsdiy.fr/mosquitto-broker-mqtt-raspberry-pi/)
- [Mosquitto information](https://everythingsmarthome.co.uk/howto/how-to-install-an-mqtt-broker-mosquitto-install-config-on-debian-ubuntu-mint-fedora-raspbian/)

### ✔️ Validation:  

If your received message, you can jump to the task 06 🎉


## Step 06 - Publish with Mosquitto

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- Your Computer
</details>

### 📌 Tasks:
You will now publish your epitech :e-mail: to the topic **/Workshop/Hardware/**. <br/>
You can find all information in the step 05 to send me your email. <br/>
If the messages appear in my log you have successfully completed this step! <br/>

Let's continue to the next step! 👏

### 📚 Documentation:
- [Publish Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html)
- [Example Pusblish](https://projetsdiy.fr/mosquitto-broker-mqtt-raspberry-pi/)

## Step 07 - Set MQTT with your esp32

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- ESP32
- USB cable

</details>

### 📑 Description:

We will set up network on your esp32 and understand how use MQTT. <br/>
Now you must publish and subscribe to topic with your esp32.

### 📌 Tasks:
- Create client
- Subscribe to `/Workshop/Hardware/Step07/`
- Publish the date time.

> 👉 Don't forget information for the communication with the broker local.

Surprise The Broker respond to you 😎 <br/>

You can pass to the last step of this Workshop !

## Step 08 - Create your Broker

<details>
    <summary> 🛠️ Required Hardware:</summary>

- Raspberry Pi
- USB cable

</details>

### 📑 Description:

Come and see a supervisor and ask for a raspberry pi 🏄

The raspberry is almost configured.

### 📌 Tasks:

Your job if you accept it is :
- to change the mosquitto configuration to subscribe to /Workshop/Hardware/Success.
- Redirect the messages to the main broker.

> 😊 After change config, don't forget to restart service.
